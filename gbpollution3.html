    <h1>Does air pollution—specifically tiny atmospheric particles (aerosols)—affect global warming?</h1>

        Air pollution occurs when the air contains gases, dust, smoke from fires, or fumes in harmful amounts. Tiny atmospheric particles - aerosols - are a subset of air pollution that are suspended in our atmosphere.

Aerosol can be both solid and liquid. Most are produced by natural processes such as erupting volcanoes, and some are from human industrial and agricultural activities.

Aerosols have a measurable effect on climate change. Light-colored aerosol particles can reflect incoming energy from the sun in cloud-free air and dark particles can absorb it. Over the historic period, the net effect globally was for aerosols to partially offset the rise in global mean surface temperature. Aerosols can modify how much energy clouds reflect and they can change atmospheric circulation patterns.

        Human-caused particulate air pollution has a relatively minor—and likely decreasing—impact on our climate. 

<br>Aerosol particles of human origin can have a net effect of diminishing the energy that arrives at the Earth’s surface.<br> Scientists estimate that particles produced by human activities have led to a net loss of solar energy (heat) at the ground by as much as 8 percent in densely populated areas over the past few decades. This effect, sometimes referred to as ‘solar dimming,’ <br>may have masked some of the late 20th century global warming due to heat-trapping gases.

Human activities that result in production of both reflecting and absorbing aerosol particle have been curtailed by legislation and modern technology in many places. The ‘pea soup fogs’ that so bedeviled London in Sherlock Holmes’ day, for example, were caused by particles produced by incomplete combustion of coal for heating.<br> These ‘fogs’ in London are now a thing of the past, thanks to mandatory scrubbers and other advanced combustion techniques.

Regional and temporal aerosols trends indicate shifts in regions of influence for aerosols produced from human activities. Haze clouds seen over urban regions give dramatic proof of the effects of human-induced particles in the United States, while atmospheric soot production from burning fossil fuels for energy production is still very high in many parts of Asia, including large clouds of pollution across much of China.</center>

        The primary cause of global warming is too much CO2

    <p>
        Global warming is primarily caused by emissions of too much carbon dioxide (CO2) and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere when we burn fossil fuels to generate electricity, drive our cars, and power our lives.

These heat-trapping gases spread worldwide and remain in the atmosphere for decades to centuries. Thus, as we continue to emit these gases, their atmospheric concentrations build up over time. In contrast, atmospheric aerosol particles are largely localized near their sources, and do not linger in the atmosphere for long so that, even if we continue to emit them at current rates, their atmospheric concentrations will not build up markedly over time.

The effect of long-lived global warming emissions will far outweigh the cooling effect of short-lived atmospheric particles.
