    <h2>Change in biodiversity</h2>

<p>The increase of temperatures and the climate upheavals disturb the ecosystems,<br> modify the conditions and cycles of plant reproduction.<br> The scarcity of resources and climate change are changing life habits and migratory cycles of animals.<br> We are already witnessing the disappearance of many species - including endemic species - or, conversely, the intrusion of invasive species that threaten crops and other animals.<br>
    Global warming therefore impacts biodiversity.<br> It is the balance of biodiversity that is modified and threatened.<br> According to the IPCC, a 1.5°C (34.7°F) average rise might put 20-30% of species at risk of extinction. <br>If the planet warms by more than 2°C, most ecosystems will struggle.</p>

    <p>The Earth is now about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the 1800s.<br> We are not on track to meet the Paris Agreement target to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.<br> That is considered the upper limit to avoid the worst fallout from climate change.</p>
