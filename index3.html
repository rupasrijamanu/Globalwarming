    <ul>
        <li><strong>Industrial Revolution</strong> - At the beginning of 1750, human activities such as burning of fossil fuels, 
            including coal and oil, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. About 
            2.3 trillion tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere in the 18th century.</li>
        <li><strong>Deforestation</strong> - During the photosynthesis process, trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 
            and release oxygen. Furthermore, carry out the respiration process, which permits carbon to be stored in tree trunks, 
            roots, and soil. When forests are cut down or burned, the carbon dioxide that has been stored in the trees is released 
            into the atmosphere.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Use</strong> - Energy plays an important role in all aspects of our life. The use of water consumption, 
            goods and services, transportation, economic growth, and energy (most from fossil fuels), contribute to climate change. 
            About 84% of U.S. greehouse gas emissions comes from energy demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Pollution</strong> - Pollution is known to come from cars, factories, homes, and power plants that burn fossil 
            fuels such as oil, coal, natural gas, and gasoline. Once entered in the atmosphere, it traps heat around the earth for 
            50-200 years after it is emitted.</li>

        <p>
            Global warming, driven predominantly by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes,
             has unleashed a cascade of detrimental effects on Earth's systems. The steady rise in global temperatures has triggered the 
             melting of ice sheets and glaciers, contributing to rising sea levels. This not only imperils coastal communities but also 
             intensifies the frequency and severity of extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and droughts. Concurrently, ocean 
             acidification stemming from increased carbon dioxide absorption harms marine life and coral reefs, disrupting entire ecosystems 
             and posing a threat to biodiversity. Furthermore, these climate changes exacerbate health risks, compromise food security by
              impacting agriculture, and pose significant economic challenges through damage to infrastructure and increased adaptation costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Efforts to address the impacts of global warming necessitate urgent, collective action on multiple fronts. Mitigation strategies 
            involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, and implementing
             policies that curb carbon emissions. Adaptation measures are equally crucial, involving the development of resilient infrastructure,
              conservation of ecosystems, and implementing sustainable practices across various sectors. Moreover, global cooperation and 
              commitment to climate agreements are paramount to mitigate the effects of global warming and safeguard the planet's future for
               generations to come.
