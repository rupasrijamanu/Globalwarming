<p>Climate change refers to the change in the average surface temperature on Earth. The average temp. on our planet has been 15˚C, but the past few years have seen drastic variations in the same, both up and down. Scientists say that temperatures are rising at a faster pace than ever.
    There may be several reasons for climate change as per scientific consensus, primarily being the overexploitation of fossil fuels by humans and deforestation. This results in the release of carbon dioxide & other greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, into the atmosphere.
    These gases remain trapped in the atmosphere and impose various negative effects on the ecosystem. It may include a rise in the sea level, extreme weather conditions, melting polar ice, floods, droughts causing wildfires.</p>

      <h3>Global warming aggregate index (2020)</h3>
      <p>
        The black line shows real-world observations of global mean temperature. Although there is some year-to-year variation, the Earth’s temperature has been steadily increasing since the 1960s.

This cannot be explained by natural causes. The blue line shows the estimated contribution to Earth’s temperature change from natural causes, such as changes in solar activity and volcanic eruptions. These account for some of the variation in global temperatures, but they can’t explain the overall warming.
The orange line shows the estimated contribution from human-induced global warming, caused by the burning of fossil fuels or other forms of pollution. Since this line closely follows the temperatures observed in the real world, it shows that the overall warming can largely be attributed to human activity. However, it is still not an exact match.
The red line shows the combined impacts of human-induced and natural changes. This line most closely matches the observed temperatures, and shows that human-induced changes, plus some natural forcing, has caused the global warming we see today.
